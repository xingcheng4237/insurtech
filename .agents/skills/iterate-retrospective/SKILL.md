# Retrospective

A retrospective is a structured reflection that helps teams learn from their experiences and continuously improve. By regularly examining what went well, what didn't, and what to change, teams build a culture of learning and adaptation. The value isn't just in the discussion.it's in the documented actions and follow-through.

## When to Use

- At the end of every sprint (for agile teams)
- After completing a significant project or milestone
- Following a major incident or outage
- When team dynamics feel off and need addressing
- At regular intervals (monthly, quarterly) even without specific triggers
- When onboarding new team members to establish improvement culture

## When NOT to Use

- You want one durable learning banked for the organization -> use `iterate-lessons-log`; the retro is the ceremony, the log entry outlives it
- You are scoring an OKR cycle at close -> use `measure-okr-grader`
- The reflection must end in a pivot-or-persevere call -> use `iterate-pivot-decision`
- You need a recap of a general (non-retro) meeting -> use `foundation-meeting-recap`

## Instructions

When asked to facilitate or document a retrospective, follow these steps:

1. **Set the Context**
   Define what period or project this retrospective covers, who attended, and any significant events that occurred. This frames the discussion and helps future readers understand the context.

2. **Choose a Format**
   Select a retrospective format that fits the team's needs. Common options include:
   - **Start/Stop/Continue:** Simple and direct
   - **4Ls:** Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed for
   - **Mad/Sad/Glad:** Emotion-focused
   - **Sailboat:** Visual metaphor (wind=helps, anchor=holds back)

3. **Gather Input**
   Collect observations from all team members. Ensure everyone contributes.quiet voices often have important insights. Group similar items to identify themes.

4. **Discuss and Prioritize**
   Don't try to address everything. Focus the discussion on the most impactful items. Vote or discuss to identify the top 2-3 issues to address.

5. **Define Action Items**
   Convert insights into specific, assignable actions. Every action needs an owner and a due date. Avoid vague improvements like "communicate better."

6. **Review Previous Actions**
   Check the status of action items from the last retrospective. Celebrate completions and discuss blockers for incomplete items. This builds accountability.

7. **Document for Future Reference**
   Capture the key points so they're available for future team members and for tracking patterns over time.

## Project Memory Contract

Active only when `.claude/pm-skills.local.md` exists. With no file, ignore this section entirely
and behave exactly as described above.

- **Reads:** the recent `artifacts[]` entries, so the retrospective can look at what the cycle actually produced instead of relying on recall.
- **Writes:** the lessons as an `interpretation` artifact.
- **Posture:** propose the entry and wait for confirmation before writing, unless
  `memory_auto_append: true` is set, in which case append and echo what was written.
- **Write discipline:** re-read the file immediately before writing, never from the copy that
  produced the proposal. If it changed in between, merge your entry into the current state and
  re-propose rather than overwriting; add only your own entry and leave every other field and
  section byte-identical. Nothing enforces this at runtime and the file is gitignored, so a
  careless whole-file write loses another session's work with no way to recover it.

A retrospective surfaces raw observations, patterns, and commitments at once. Record the durable half, the lessons, under a single tag; a downstream reader needs to know how firmly to weight the entry, and a mixed tag tells it nothing.
## Output Format

Use the template in `references/TEMPLATE.md` to structure the output. A complete retrospective fills every template section: Overview; Previous Retrospective Review; What Went Well; What to Improve; Discussion Notes; Action Items; Parking Lot; Metrics and Trends; Facilitator Notes; and Next Retrospective.

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] All attendees had opportunity to contribute
- [ ] Both positives and improvements are captured
- [ ] Action items have owners and due dates
- [ ] Previous retrospective actions are reviewed
- [ ] A reader who missed the retro can tell what was decided and who owns each action from this document alone

## Examples

See `references/EXAMPLE.md` for a completed example.
