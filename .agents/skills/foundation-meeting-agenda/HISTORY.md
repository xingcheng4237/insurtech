## 1.1.0 (2026-08-08)

Released in v2.32.0. Effort: F-54 (memory-aware cohort, B2).

Adds a `## Project Memory Contract` section declaring what this skill reads from and appends to
`.claude/pm-skills.local.md`. Additive and inert: with no memory file the skill behaves exactly as
before. Writes are proposed for confirmation unless `memory_auto_append: true` is set.

### Changes
- Declared the project-memory read/write contract.
## 1.0.1 (2026-07-04)

Released in [v2.30.0](../../site/src/content/docs/releases/Release_v2.30.0.md). Effort: M-35 (trust repair sweep).

Heading-normalization sweep (WS-T8b): the 2026-07-04 deep audit found "Quality checklist" (lowercase c) as one of 11 catalog instances of the canon "Quality Checklist" heading drifting to a lowercase variant that evaded case-sensitive tooling. No content or behavior change.

## 1.0.0 (2026-04-17)

Released in [v2.11.0](../../site/src/content/docs/releases/Release_v2.11.0.md). Effort: F-18.

Initial release: produces an attendee-facing agenda setting what will be discussed, who owns each topic, and how time will be spent, across ten meeting-type variants.

### Contract established
- Ten meeting-type variants (standup, planning, review, decision-making, brainstorm, 1-on-1, stakeholder-review, project-kickoff, working-session, exec-briefing)
- Anti-meeting check with a synchronous-value requirement
- Output: a shareable summary plus a full time-boxed agenda with owners, prep, and logistics
