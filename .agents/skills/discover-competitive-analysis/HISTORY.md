| 2.2.0 | 2026-07-04 | v2.30.0 | M-35 | minor | Rewrote the frontmatter description: added output specifics (competitor count, 2x2 map) and the sibling deflection to `discover-market-sizing` already present in the body. One of the four additional Batch 5 skills selected for this release alongside the spec's four named examples (see the trust-repair spec's WS-T8e "~4 more early-cohort descriptions"). |

## 2.2.1 (2026-07-31)

Released in [v2.32.0](../../site/src/content/docs/releases/Release_v2.32.0.md). Effort: issue-248 (external report).

An external reader reported three fused sentence boundaries in the Instructions, where a missing space or terminator ran two sentences together. Prose defect only; the guidance itself was already correct.

### Changes
- Repaired the fused boundaries at `competitors.direct`, `competitors.respect`, and `reliability.be` in the Instructions section.

No change to the frontmatter description, Output Format, Quality Checklist, template, or example. No behavior change, which is why this is a patch rather than a minor.

## 2.2.0 (2026-07-04)

Released in [v2.30.0](../../site/src/content/docs/releases/Release_v2.30.0.md). Effort: M-35 (trust repair sweep).

The 2026-07-04 deep audit named the catalog's ~8 weakest early-cohort descriptions for rewrite (Batch 5), naming four skills explicitly and leaving roughly four more to selection; this skill was picked for its short, generic description and its unstated boundary against `discover-market-sizing`, a real neighbor already tested by this skill's trigger fixtures.

### Changes
- Rewrote the frontmatter description (Batch 5, WS-T8e) to name what the analysis compares (features, pricing, positioning), its typical scope (3-5 competitors, a 2x2 map), and the `discover-market-sizing` deflection already present in the "When NOT to Use" section.

No change to the Instructions, Output Format, or Quality Checklist.

## 2.1.0 (2026-06-10)

Quality-convergence minor (F-12 Batch 3): added a "When NOT to Use" section with boundary pointers to neighboring skills, and the Output Format now enumerates the template sections a complete artifact fills. No template or example changes.

## 2.0.0 (2026-01-26)
