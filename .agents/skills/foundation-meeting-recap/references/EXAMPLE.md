# Meeting recap: Search Feature Kickoff

## Shareable summary

**Search Feature Kickoff** | 2026-04-17
Scope and capacity agreed; timeline deferred to a follow-up next week due to emergent vendor-contract question on the search provider.

**Key decisions**:
- MVP scope: autocomplete + filters IN; saved searches OUT (defer to v2)
- Q2 eng capacity: 8 sprint-weeks committed; alex owns staffing plan

**Top actions**:
- alex: publish sprint-week staffing plan (Due: 2026-04-24)
- maria: investigate vendor contract constraints on search provider (Due: 2026-04-22)
- jonathan: schedule follow-up for timeline commitment after vendor answer (Due: 2026-04-25)

## Full recap

### Meeting details

- **Date**: 2026-04-17
- **Actual duration**: 68 min (overran by 8 min)
- **Attendees present**: jonathan, maria, alex, sarah
- **Attendees absent**: none
- **Recording**: https://meet.example/search-kickoff/recording

### Overall summary

Agreed on MVP scope (autocomplete + filters in; saved searches deferred) and Q2 engineering capacity (8 sprint-weeks). Timeline commitment deferred to next week because an emergent question on the search-provider vendor contract needs resolution before a date can be committed. Meeting ran 8 minutes over due to the vendor-contract tangent.

### Agenda reconciliation

- **Planned topics**: scope, capacity, timeline, next-steps
- **Topics addressed**: scope, capacity (2 of 4)
- **Topics skipped**: timeline. deferred because vendor contract question blocks commitment; next-steps. absorbed into emergent vendor-contract discussion
- **Topics that emerged**: vendor-contract-review. alex raised a prior email from the search-provider indicating potential licensing limits on usage; needs investigation before timeline is committable

### Topics

#### Scope

*Type: Decision (from agenda)*

**Discussion**

Walked the scope draft together. Autocomplete and filters had clear customer-research backing; saved searches was the contested line. Agreed that saved searches solves a narrower user need and can be deferred without losing the MVP value prop.

**Decisions made**

- **MVP scope: autocomplete IN, filters IN, saved searches OUT (defer to v2)**. rationale: autocomplete + filters cover 80% of the research-identified user need; saved searches adds complexity (accounts, persistence) that costs Q2 engineering time without proportional customer-value gain

**Actions**

- [ ] maria: update scope doc to reflect decision; circulate for final sign-off by EOD Friday | Due: 2026-04-18 | Dependencies: none
- [ ] jonathan: add saved-searches to v2 backlog with rationale link | Due: 2026-04-18

**Open questions**

- None on scope itself; vendor contract issue (see below) may force scope reconsideration if licensing blocks autocomplete

---

#### Capacity

*Type: Decision (from agenda)*

**Discussion**

Alex walked the Q2 capacity model. 8 sprint-weeks available for search; no backfill needed if scope holds. Flagged that saved-searches would have required 3 additional sprint-weeks, reinforcing the scope decision.

**Decisions made**

- **Q2 engineering capacity: 8 sprint-weeks committed to search feature**. rationale: fits within scope agreed in prior topic; no backfill required

**Actions**

- [ ] alex: publish detailed sprint-week staffing plan (who, which sprint) | Due: 2026-04-24
- [ ] alex: flag dependencies on design-system team if any emerge | Due: 2026-04-24

**Open questions**

- None

---

#### Vendor-contract-review (emergent)

*Type: Discussion (emergent. not on agenda)*

**Discussion**

Alex surfaced a prior email from the search-provider (Algolia) indicating possible licensing limits on query volume at our projected usage. Raised concern that if limits trigger, we could be forced to renegotiate or re-architect. Decision was to investigate before committing to a ship timeline.

**Decisions made**

- **Defer timeline commitment until vendor contract is reviewed** [confidence: high]. rationale: committing a date before vendor-licensing risk is known would create rework

**Actions**

- [ ] maria: investigate vendor contract constraints (read licensing terms; query legal if needed) | Due: 2026-04-22 | Dependencies: legal review if terms are ambiguous
- [ ] jonathan: schedule 30-min follow-up for the week of 2026-04-21 once maria has vendor answer | Due: 2026-04-25

**Open questions**

- Does vendor licensing support our projected Q2 query volume? [confidence: high. specific question]
- If limits apply, are they negotiable or hard? [confidence: medium. depends on legal review]
