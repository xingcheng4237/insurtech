## 1.2.0 (2026-08-08)

Released in v2.32.0. Effort: F-54 (memory-aware cohort, B2).

Adds a `## Project Memory Contract` section declaring what this skill reads from and appends to
`.claude/pm-skills.local.md`. Additive and inert: with no memory file the skill behaves exactly as
before. Writes are proposed for confirmation unless `memory_auto_append: true` is set.

### Changes
- Declared the project-memory read/write contract.
## 1.1.0 (2026-07-05)

Released in [v2.31.0](../../site/src/content/docs/releases/Release_v2.31.0.md). Effort: WS-Z5 (eval backfill wave 1, R-16).

The WS-Z5 fixture backfill declared both `foundation-meeting-agenda` and `foundation-meeting-brief` as new collision pairs for this skill in `scripts/trigger-eval-roster.yaml`, but neither reciprocal "When NOT to Use" pointer was added. The enforcing `check-reciprocal-boundary-pointers` gate caught both gaps. Adds one bullet pointing to `foundation-meeting-agenda` (pre-meeting structure) and one bullet pointing to `foundation-meeting-brief` (pre-meeting private prep), both distinguishing this skill's post-meeting scope. No other content change.

## 1.0.3 (2026-07-04)

Released in [v2.30.0](../../site/src/content/docs/releases/Release_v2.30.0.md). Effort: M-35 (trust repair sweep).

Heading-normalization sweep (WS-T8b): the 2026-07-04 deep audit found "Quality checklist" (lowercase c) as one of 11 catalog instances of the canon "Quality Checklist" heading drifting to a lowercase variant that evaded case-sensitive tooling. No content or behavior change.

## 1.0.2 (2026-06-14)

Reciprocity patch (C-5): added a "When NOT to Use" body bullet pointing to discover-interview-synthesis, the reciprocal of that skill's existing back-pointer. The 1.0.1 patch added only the description sentence; the C-5 reciprocal-boundary-pointer validator reads the body section, so the body bullet was still missing. Closing it lets the C-5 gate promote advisory -> enforcing. No template or behavior changes.

## 1.0.1 (2026-06-10)

Description-only patch (F-12 Batch 0, from the 2026-06-09 repo audit): one boundary sentence appended, pointing cross-participant research synthesis to discover-interview-synthesis. No body, template, or behavior changes.

## 1.0.0 (2026-04-17)
