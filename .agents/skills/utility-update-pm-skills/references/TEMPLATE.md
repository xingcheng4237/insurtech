## What's New

<!-- This is the centerpiece of the report. Tell the value story. -->

### Headline

{1-2 sentence narrative summarizing the update's value. Frame in terms of
what the user can now DO, not what files changed.}

<!-- Example: "This update adds meeting synthesis and slideshow creation,
expanding pm-skills from a planning toolkit into a presentation and
communication platform." -->

### New Skills

<!-- If no new skills: "No new skills in this update." -->

| Skill | What It Enables |
|-------|-----------------|
| {skill-name} | {What this skill lets the user do -- the capability, not just the description} |

### Updated Skills

<!-- If no updated skills: "No skills were updated." -->

| Skill | What Improved | Why It Matters |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| {skill-name} | {What changed} | {How this benefits the user} |

### New Workflows

<!-- If no new workflows: "No new workflows in this update." -->

| Workflow | What It Connects |
|----------|-----------------|
| {workflow-name} | {Which skills it chains and what outcome it produces} |

### Other Changes

<!-- Bullet list of notable changes. If none: "No other notable changes." -->

- {Change description}

### Opportunities

{2-3 sentences describing what the user can now do that they couldn't before.
Ground suggestions in detected skills and workflows - reference actual new
capabilities by name with their slash commands (e.g., "Try `utility-mermaid-diagrams`
on your next PRD"). Label speculative pairings as suggestions. Link workflows
to their component skills.}

<!-- Example: "With the new `utility-slideshow-creator` skill, you can now go from a
PRD directly to a stakeholder presentation without leaving Claude. Try
pairing it with `foundation-persona` to create audience-tailored decks. The new
discover-to-present workflow chains `discover-interview-synthesis` → `define-problem-statement`
→ `develop-solution-brief` → `utility-slideshow-creator` into a single flow." -->

## Files {Written / That Would Be Written}

<!-- Use "Files Written" for completion reports, "Files That Would Be Written"
     for report-only. -->

| Directory | Files | New | Updated |
|-----------|-------|-----|---------|
| `skills/` | {n} | {n new} | {n updated} |
| `commands/` | {n} | {n new} | {n updated} |
| `_workflows/` | {n} | {n new} | {n updated} |
| Other | {n} | {n new} | {n updated} |
| **Total** | **{n}** | **{n new}** | **{n updated}** |
