## Persona Card

**Rhea Patel - Keeper of the Approval Chain**
Rhea runs clinical quality operations and holds the last signature before a submission package ships. She serves the reviewers upstream of her and the auditors downstream, and she is the person who gets asked, months later, why a decision was made. Her relationship with the product is defined by that asymmetry: everyone else is optimizing for today, and she is answering for it later.

**Key quote** [fictional, as is every quote and count in this example]**:** "I do not need it to be fast. I need to be able to stand behind it in a year when nobody remembers the context."

**Goals.** Ship on time without carrying hidden assumptions past the gate. Make accountability legible so exceptions do not become orphans. Reconstruct any decision quickly when it is questioned. Spend her scarce attention on the few approvals that actually carry risk.

**Frustrations.** A green status that hides unresolved uncertainty. High-impact approvals recorded with no rationale. Exceptions granted under deadline with no owner or expiry. Evidence links that have gone stale since the approval. Being read as an obstacle by people who will not be in the room for the audit.

**Design rules - always.** Show why something passed, not just that it passed. Make ownership explicit at the moment an exception is created. Apply the same validation rules in the working flow and in the exported package.

**Design rules - never.** Never flatten low-risk and high-risk approvals into one undifferentiated flow. Never display an aggregate green state while a critical item is unresolved. Never let a deadline override remove the requirement to record a reason.

## 1. Demographics & Identity

| Attribute | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Age | 41 |
| Location | Boston, hybrid, three days on site |
| Education | BS Biology, later a regulatory affairs certification |
| Role | Director, Clinical Quality Operations |
| Company size | 900 employees, mid-size regulated device manufacturer |
| Team | Six direct reports, mix of quality specialists and document controllers |
| Reports to | VP Regulatory Affairs, skip level to Chief Quality Officer |
| Stakeholders | Clinical operations, regulatory submissions, external auditors, occasionally legal |
| Purchasing role | Influencer. She does not sign, but a veto from her ends an evaluation |
| Accessibility | Works across two monitors with dense tables; increases browser zoom in late-day review sessions and loses layouts that assume a fixed viewport |

**Career stage and trajectory.** Rhea moved from bench science into quality operations a decade ago and has built her reputation on submissions that survive inspection without findings. She is being positioned for a VP role, and the thing that would most damage that path is a preventable audit finding traced to a process she owned. That shapes every tool decision she makes: she is not evaluating for personal efficiency, she is evaluating for defensibility.

**Organizational leverage.** Her influence exceeds her title. Nothing ships without her gate, so when she declines to approve, timelines move and executives hear about it. That leverage is also a burden: teams route around her when they can, which means she often learns about a shortcut after it has already been taken.

## 2. Technology & Environment Context

| Tool | Role |
| --- | --- |
| The approval workflow product | Where submissions are routed, reviewed, and gated |
| Regulated document management system | System of record for controlled documents; the destination her packages must satisfy |
| Slack | Where the real negotiation happens, and where approvals get informally pre-agreed before they appear in the tool |
| Spreadsheet exception tracker | Her personal shadow system for exceptions the product does not model well |
| Audit-log export | What she actually reaches for when a decision is questioned months later |

**Digital fluency level.** Rhea is fluent in regulated systems and comfortable with structured data, filters, and exports. She is not a scripter and will not build an integration. She understands state machines and permission models conceptually because her job depends on them, so she asks precise questions about what a status actually means and is unsatisfied by vague answers.

**Adoption and abandonment patterns.** She evaluates a tool by trying to break its audit story: she will approve something, then immediately try to reconstruct why. If the reconstruction is hard, the tool is disqualified regardless of how good the daily workflow feels. She abandons quietly, by building a spreadsheet alongside the product rather than complaining, which means her dissatisfaction is invisible until the shadow system is entrenched.

**Work environment.** Dense information, high interruption, and long sessions clustered around submission deadlines. She reviews in focused blocks early morning and in fragmented pockets late in the day, and the late-day fragments are exactly when high-impact approvals arrive.

---

## 3. Jobs to Be Done

**Functional.** When a submission package reaches the final gate, she needs to determine whether every high-impact decision is supported and owned, so that she can approve without carrying unresolved risk into a regulated filing.

**Emotional.** When she signs, she wants to feel that she could defend the decision cold, without context, so that approving does not create a low-grade dread that surfaces every time an audit is scheduled.

**Social.** She wants to be seen as the person who makes shipping safe rather than the person who makes shipping slow. The social cost of being read as an obstacle is real, and it is why she looks for ways to say yes with conditions instead of no.

**Underlying.** The deeper job is converting distributed, informal judgment into something that survives the loss of context. Everyone else's job ends at the decision; hers begins there. She is not managing a workflow, she is managing the future readability of decisions made by people who will have moved on.

---

## 4. Goals & Motivations

**Life goal.** To be the person whose systems hold up under scrutiny, and to reach a VP role on the strength of a record with no preventable findings.

**Approve high-impact items with complete rationale.** She wants every consequential approval to carry its reasoning at the moment it is made. This demands that the product distinguish high-impact from routine and require more at the higher tier, rather than treating a rationale field as universally optional.

**Close every exception with a named owner.** She wants exceptions to be temporary by construction. This demands that the product model owner, reason, expiry, and follow-up as required fields rather than free text, and that it surface exceptions approaching expiry.

**Reconstruct any decision in under ten minutes.** She wants to answer an auditor's question without a forensic exercise. This demands durable evidence links and an export that carries the same context the working view had.

**Feel proportionate rather than uniformly heavy.** She wants the friction concentrated where risk is, so routine approvals move quickly.

**Feel informed before she is asked.** She wants to learn about a problem from the product, not from a stakeholder in a hallway.

**Feel confident in the export.** She wants what leaves the system to match what she saw when she approved it.

---

## 5. Behavioral Patterns & Mental Models

**Core mental model.** Rhea thinks in terms of a chain of custody for decisions, not a workflow. Each approval is a link, and the question she asks of any link is whether it will hold when pulled on later. She does not experience a status field as information; she experiences it as a claim someone made, and her instinct is to ask who made it and on what basis. This is why aggregate status indicators frustrate her disproportionately: a green badge is a summary of claims, and she needs the claims.

**Primary work pattern.** Roughly two thirds reactive, responding to items arriving at her gate, and one third proactive process work she rarely protects successfully. She wants that ratio closer to even, and the reactive share spikes hard in the week before a submission deadline.

**Accuracy and quality approach.** She verifies by sampling rather than exhaustively, choosing samples by risk rather than at random. Good enough means the decision is supported and the support is findable. Her standard does not relax under deadline, but her tolerance for how the support is captured does.

**Tolerance thresholds.** She loses patience with configuration that requires understanding the product's internal model, and with any flow that makes her re-enter context the system already has. She will tolerate significant slowness in exchange for certainty, which is unusual and worth designing around.

---

## 6. Decision-Making & Trust Patterns

**How trust is built and broken.** Trust builds slowly through correct behavior in unremarkable cases and breaks in a single event: one contradictory approval, or one stale evidence link discovered during an audit, moves her permanently to verifying externally. She described a prior tool where one bad export ended her reliance on it entirely, after eighteen months of satisfactory use.

**Adoption filter.** Her implicit checklist runs roughly: can I reconstruct a decision made in this system a year from now, does it distinguish consequential from routine, does what I export match what I saw, and does it make ownership explicit or leave it implied. A tool that fails the first question is disqualified regardless of the rest.

**Risk profile.** Risk-tolerant about process change and risk-averse about evidence. She will pilot a new workflow willingly and will not accept a new system of record without a migration story for historical decisions.

**Feature discovery behavior.** Almost entirely accidental or peer-mediated. She does not read release notes and does not explore. Capability she is not told about directly is capability she does not have.

---

## 7. Workflow & Collaboration Context

**Work rhythm.** Anchored hard to submission deadlines, with the approval load arriving late and compressed. She has perhaps two protected hours early each day and fragmented attention afterward. The riskiest approvals disproportionately arrive during the fragmented window, which is a product problem disguised as a scheduling one.

**Collaboration model.** She is a reviewer and gatekeeper, rarely an author. Her counterparts are clinical and regulatory authors upstream, and auditors and regulators downstream who consume her output long after the fact. That downstream consumer never appears in the product, which is precisely why the product under-serves her.

**Key collaboration friction.** Approvals get informally negotiated in Slack and then recorded in the tool as a formality, so the recorded artifact captures the conclusion and loses the reasoning. She receives a decision with the argument stripped out and is expected to ratify it.

**Dependencies.** She depends on upstream authors to supply complete evidence, on reviewers to apply consistent standards, and on stakeholders to be available for clarification during compressed windows. When a submission slips, she is blamed for the gate rather than the inputs.

---

## 8. Current Alternatives & Workarounds

**Primary alternative.** A personal spreadsheet tracking exceptions, owners, and expiry dates, maintained in parallel with the product. It persists because it models the thing she actually manages, which is the lifecycle of an exception, whereas the product models the moment an exception was granted. It is fragile, unshared, and she knows it is a liability.

**Where the product enters.** It is the system of record for the approval event itself and is trusted for that narrow purpose. Its position is more fragile than usage metrics suggest, because the work she does around it is invisible to the product.

**The firing trigger.** Not one dramatic failure but a pattern: two or three occasions where the product's record could not answer a question she was asked, each pushing more of the real work into the spreadsheet. The tool does not get abandoned, it gets hollowed out.

---

## 9. Pain Points & Unmet Needs

**High-impact approvals recorded without rationale.** The product accepts an approval on a consequential item with no reasoning captured, because the rationale field is optional everywhere. It persists because making it universally required would burden routine approvals, so it stays optional everywhere instead. The cost is paid months later in reconstruction time and, occasionally, in an audit finding.

**Exceptions without owners or expiry.** An exception can be granted under deadline pressure with nothing but a note. It persists because the deadline case is exactly when nobody wants another required field. The cost is a growing population of open exceptions nobody is accountable for, which is the single largest source of her shadow spreadsheet.

**Aggregate status hides unresolved items.** A package shows green while a critical item remains open, because the status rolls up completion rather than risk. It persists because the rollup was designed for progress reporting, not for gating. The cost is a false sense of readiness that reaches Slack before it reaches her.

**Export loses the context of the working view.** What she reviewed and what leaves the system are assembled by different logic, so the export can omit rationale or resolve a link differently. It persists because the two paths were built at different times. The cost is that her audit artifact is not the thing she approved.

**Stale evidence links.** A link that resolved at approval time points somewhere else, or nowhere, months later. It persists because links are stored as references without snapshots. The cost is direct: it is the failure mode most likely to produce an actual finding.

**Contradictory approvals go undetected.** Two reviewers can approve incompatible states of the same item without the system noticing. It persists because approvals are recorded per item rather than evaluated for coherence. The cost is discovered late, usually by her, usually at the gate.

---

## 10. Success Definition & Quality Bar

**Accuracy standard.** Zero tolerance on evidence and ownership, and pragmatic tolerance on presentation. A decision may be recorded tersely; it may not be recorded without a basis.

**Timeliness standard.** On time means the gate does not become the reason for a slip. She measures her own performance partly by how rarely she is the critical path, which is why she is more receptive to proportional friction than to uniform speed.

**Self-sufficiency standard.** A successful output stands alone. Someone with no context should be able to open the record and understand what was decided, by whom, on what basis, and what remains open.

**Quality bar by context.** In normal operation she expects full rationale on high-impact items and light-touch recording elsewhere. In deadline compression she will accept abbreviated rationale in exchange for explicit exception governance: owner, reason, expiry, and follow-up become non-negotiable precisely when everything else relaxes. In an incident or audit response the bar inverts entirely, and reconstruction speed dominates everything, including her willingness to tolerate an awkward interface.

---

## 11. Design Principles & Tradeoff Heuristics

**Legibility over brevity.** When a status could be shorter or more explicable, choose explicable. Her entire job is answering questions about decisions after the context is gone.

**Proportional friction over uniform friction.** When adding a required field, add it at the high-impact tier rather than everywhere. Uniform requirements get satisfied uniformly badly, which destroys the signal on the items that matter.

**Explicit ownership over inferred ownership.** When the system could infer an owner from context, require one instead. An inferred owner is not an owner when the exception is questioned.

**Structured exceptions over free-text exceptions.** When accommodating an edge case under deadline, model it with owner, reason, expiry, and follow-up rather than a comment field. The comment field is where her shadow spreadsheet comes from.

**Parity over convenience.** When the working view and the export could diverge for implementation convenience, keep them identical. A divergence here converts her audit artifact into a guess.

**Risk rollup over completion rollup.** When summarizing package state, summarize by unresolved risk rather than percentage complete. A green completion bar over an open critical item is worse than no summary at all.

**Snapshot over reference.** When linking evidence, capture what was seen at approval time rather than a pointer that resolves later. This is the difference between a record and a hope.

## Evidence & Confidence

| Source | Type | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
<!-- Every source, count and quote below is [fictional], invented to show the SHAPE of an evidence
     ledger. None of it exists. The point of this section is that each claim names the study that
     supports it and each unsupported claim is labelled as such; it is not a licence to invent
     precise provenance. In a real persona these rows cite studies you actually ran. -->

| Source | Type | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| I1-I5 | Interview | Five [fictional] quality and compliance operations leads at regulated manufacturers, 45-60 minutes each, 2026-06 to 2026-07 |
| S1 | Support | 14 months of support tickets tagged approvals or exceptions, 312 [fictional] tickets reviewed and themed |
| A1 | Analytics | Audit-log export analysis across 4 [fictional] customer tenants: rationale-field completion by impact tier |
| W1 | Session recording | Three [fictional] recorded submission-gate sessions, observed rather than self-reported |

**Validated against the sources above, which are themselves [fictional].** The behavioral model in sections 5 and 6, the exception-lifecycle pain point, and the export-parity failure each name a study that supports them, which is what "validated" has to mean here: traceable to a source, not merely plausible. The shadow-spreadsheet workaround appeared unprompted in four of five [fictional] interviews. In your own persona this label is earned by real studies or it is not earned at all.

**Assumed.** The demographic detail in section 1 is composite rather than observed. The quality-bar shifts in section 10 come from interview self-report and have not been observed under real deadline compression, which is exactly the condition where self-report is least reliable. Validating that would require observing a live submission window rather than asking about one.

**Open questions.** What is the current re-open-after-approval rate by workflow stage, and does it concentrate in the late-day fragmented window as the behavioral model predicts? Which reviewer cohorts show the widest variance in rationale quality, and is variance driven by role or by time pressure? What are the recurring exception classes by frequency, and who actually owns them today?

**Governance.** Review every two quarters, or immediately after any audit finding touching the approval chain. Retire when the regulated-workflow segment falls below a quarter of new revenue, or when a successor persona based on observed rather than self-reported deadline behavior supersedes it. Next planned research: observe one live submission window, target 2026-10-31.
