description: Run an ordered sequence of pm-skills against one input, pausing for go/no-go and stopping on a failed or empty step. Accepts a saved prioritized action plan (Mode A) or an ad-hoc named chain (Mode B; the chain command routes here). Explicit invocation only; run --dry-run first while the native path is EXPERIMENTAL. To author a durable workflow instead, use utility-pm-workflow-builder.

# PM Workflow Orchestrator (Dispatch Skill)

Cross-client dispatch wrapper for the `pm-workflow-orchestrator` sub-agent. Detects the runtime; dispatches to the native sub-agent on Claude Code; reads `agents/pm-workflow-orchestrator.md` and walks the run loop inline on non-Claude clients via the "reference + execute inline" pattern. The orchestrator runs an ordered sequence of pm-skills from a saved prioritized-action-plan (Mode A) or a user-named chain (Mode B), pausing for go/no-go by default and stopping on a failed or empty step.

> **Status summary (updated v2.26.0):** smoke-tested on the native Claude Code path; EXPERIMENTAL elsewhere.
> - **Claude Code (native): Mode B chains SMOKE-TESTED PASS (2026-06-10, installed plugin).** The live run confirmed the engine invokes downstream skills via the `Skill` tool and that they execute INLINE in the engine's context (the Skill tool injects the target SKILL.md into the caller's context; no sub-agent is spawned), with real artifacts produced and the checkpoint pause honored. Mode A native runs and a single continuous interactive engine instance across multiple checkpoints have not yet been exercised; details and caveats in the compatibility matrix's v2.26.0 smoke-gate record.
> - **All non-Claude clients (Codex CLI, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot CLI, Gemini CLI):** EXPERIMENTAL until a dedicated maintainer-gate test exercises a real multi-artifact inline WRITE run. The orchestrator writes up to three full PM artifacts and may thread state; this is strictly harder than the conductor's inline path and has never been live-validated off Claude Code.
>
> On ANY client, run `--dry-run` FIRST as the readiness check (it exercises parsing, checkpointing, stop-on-fail, and the tool-capability pre-flight without invoking consequential skills). See the [Sub-Agent Compatibility Matrix](../../docs/reference/sub-agent-compatibility.md) for the canonical safe-usage matrix.

## When to Use

- You produced a `foundation-prioritized-action-plan` and want to run its runnable Section 7 prompts in order, pausing for go/no-go (Mode A).
- You want to run an ad-hoc, user-named chain of pm-skills against shared context (Mode B), for example `deliver-prd` then `deliver-user-stories`. On Claude Code, the /chain command is the terse front door for this mode.
- You want a generic runner for a dynamic chain that is NOT a pre-curated `workflow-*` command.

Run modes (orthogonal to client):

- **CHECKPOINTED (default):** pause after each OK step for approve / edit / skip / redo.
- **GUARDED AUTO (`--auto`, opt-in):** run without pausing on clean steps; still stop on failed, pause on empty, and stay checkpointed for Complex / Chaotic plans unless `--force-auto`.

`--thread` declares a linear dependency so each step receives the prior step's confirmed artifact; see the Mode B Chain Expression Contract in `references/PARSE-CONTRACT.md`.

## When NOT to Use

- You want a fixed, curated, named chain that an author maintains by hand (for example a full Foundation Sprint or Customer Discovery) -> use the existing `workflow-*` command (`workflow-foundation-sprint`, `workflow-customer-discovery`, ...). The orchestrator does NOT supersede those and surfaces a workflow step as MANUAL rather than nesting it.
- You only need to PRODUCE a prioritized action plan (not run it) -> use `foundation-prioritized-action-plan` (which can then offer to hand its plan here).
- You only need to review one artifact -> use `utility-pm-critic`.
- You want to run library-maintenance machinery as if it were PM work -> the orchestrator refuses Tier-3 maintenance skills.
- You want to AUTHOR a reusable workflow rather than run a chain right now -> use `utility-pm-workflow-builder`. That skill produces a durable, named workflow; this one runs an ephemeral chain and persists no definition.

## Instructions

**Runtime detection step.** Determine which AI client is invoking this skill. Run mode (checkpointed vs auto) comes from the user's flags and is independent of the client.

### If you are running in Claude Code with the pm-skills plugin installed

Invoke `@agent-pm-skills:pm-workflow-orchestrator` with the user's input plus any flags from `$ARGUMENTS` (`--auto`, `--force-auto`, `--dry-run`). The native sub-agent parses the input, builds the step list, and delegates each step via the `Skill` tool to the real downstream skill, running its own per-step loop with confirmation pauses. Relay the engine's per-step output blocks and the terminal output to the user.

This path is EXPERIMENTAL at v2.24.0 (see Status summary). Instruct the user to run `--dry-run` first.

### If you are running in any other AI client

Codex CLI, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot CLI, Gemini CLI, or any client without native pm-skills plugin sub-agent support:

1. **Tool-capability pre-flight (FIRST action, before parsing or step 1).** Verify the client can (a) write a file under `_pm-skills/plan-orchestrator/<run>/` and (b) run any Bash a downstream skill needs.
   - If file write is unavailable: degrade explicitly to CHAT-ONLY mode (warn that multi-step reliability drops and context budget rises because full artifacts must stay in-window) for short runs, or refuse a long run with a clear message. Do not fail mid-chain.
   - If Bash is unavailable for a step that needs it: surface that step as blocked at its boundary.
   - Record the detected capabilities; they govern disk-write below.
2. Read the canonical sub-agent definition at `agents/pm-workflow-orchestrator.md`.
3. Read the shared parse and step-status contract at `references/PARSE-CONTRACT.md` (the engine reads the same file; this is what keeps the inline branch and the engine from drifting).
4. Execute the engine body as your operating instructions: run the pre-flight refusals, build the ordered step list (Mode A parse or Mode B named chain), then walk the per-step loop.
5. At each step, read the downstream skill's `SKILL.md` and execute its method inline in this window; classify the return PRODUCED / EMPTY / FAILED with the rubric in `references/PARSE-CONTRACT.md`; write `NN-<skill-name>.md` to the run directory when disk-write is on.
6. Honor the run mode: pause at each OK step in CHECKPOINTED; auto-advance only unambiguously-PRODUCED steps in GUARDED AUTO; a FAILED step STOPS the run; an EMPTY or ambiguous step always pauses for confirmation (a forced checkpoint pause the user can clear), regardless of `--force-auto`.
7. Emit the terminal output (run complete or halted) per the engine's section 4.5.

The "reference + execute inline" pattern is what enables cross-client compatibility. It is EXPERIMENTAL here until the maintainer-gate WRITE harness validates a real multi-artifact run on each client.

## `--dry-run` (readiness probe; run this FIRST on any client)

`--dry-run` walks the full step list and exercises parsing, checkpointing, stop-on-fail, and the tool-capability pre-flight, but does NOT invoke any consequential downstream skill. Each step emits "NOT EXECUTED - dry run" plus what WOULD happen (which skill, which mode, whether disk-write would engage). Use it to confirm the plan parses, the chain resolves, and the client has the tool access the live run needs, before spending tokens on real delegation.

## Cross-Client Notes

Because non-Claude clients run the loop and every step inline in ONE context window:

1. **Context budget.** The combined budget (engine body + per-step downstream skill reads + produced artifacts) can approach context limits on multi-step runs. The engine auto-enables disk-write for 2+ step runs and keeps only a one-line summary per completed step in context; CHAT-ONLY mode loses that mitigation, so prefer a write-capable client for long chains.
2. **Tool authorization.** Inline execution must have file-write and Bash access (not Read-only). The pre-flight (step 1 above) checks this. Codex may need its sandbox write flag enabled; Cursor and Gemini may interpose approval gates per step.
3. **No native chaining.** This is why the engine delegates by `Skill` (Claude Code) or inline read-and-execute (non-Claude), never by spawning a sub-agent. A Mode A step that resolves to a dispatch skill which would fan out to a sub-agent (only `utility-pm-critic`) is handled by inlining the leaf agent, never by chaining (engine section 7.2).
