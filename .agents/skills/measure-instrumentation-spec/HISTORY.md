# measure-instrumentation-spec - Version History

| Version | Date | Release | Effort | Type | Summary |
|---------|------|---------|--------|------|---------|
| 3.0.0 | 2026-08-21 | v2.33.0 | C-1 | **major** | Privacy section extended with a conditional `Model Trace Capture` subsection: what is captured, data classes, minimization decided separately at the egress and storage boundaries with a stated failure behavior, retention, sampling, who can read a trace, and user opt-out. Event Inventory untouched. **Also broadens the trigger** from user input only to any captured model input, output, retrieval context, or tool call, and adds a data-classes decision, because a feature with no direct user input can still write tenant documents into a trace store. **Retyped from 2.3.0 minor before release** (G1 adversarial findings 1 and 2). 2.3.0 never shipped. |
| 2.2.0 | 2026-07-04 | v2.30.0 | M-35 | minor | Rewrote the frontmatter description: added the product-engineering contract framing and the sibling deflection to `measure-dashboard-requirements`, its collision-pair companion in this release's Batch 5. |
| 2.1.0 | 2026-06-10 | v2.26.0 | F-12-batch-4 | minor | Quality convergence: When NOT to Use + output-contract enumeration (F-12 Batch 4) |
| 2.0.0 | 2026-01-26 | - | - | baseline | Prior published version |

## 3.0.0 (2026-08-21)

AI-product family Track 1 (effort C-1), the `measure-instrumentation-spec` increment ruled in
[the C-3 spec](../../docs/internal/release-plans/v2.32.0/spec_c3-ai-product-family.md) section 2.2.
Extends the existing `PII & Privacy Considerations` section with a conditional `Model Trace Capture`
subsection. No new top-level section, so the Output Format enumeration is unchanged.

**Hardened at G1 round 2 (2026-08-25), before release.** The round-1 template offered a single
`Redaction before storage` row that folded the egress question in as a rider, so a PM could complete
it while raw tenant content still crossed into an external collector ahead of redaction. That
contradicted this skill's own Quality Checklist, which already required minimization to be decided
at both boundaries. The template now carries separate pre-egress and pre-storage decisions plus an
explicit fail-closed behavior row for each boundary, and the Testing Checklist gained a conditional `Trace Capture
Validation` block of negative tests that pass by proving raw traces do not cross either boundary
when minimization fails.

**Why privacy and not observability.** A trace is not an event. An event carries properties chosen
in advance; a trace carries what the user typed and what the model wrote back, which is free text
that can contain anything the user decided to put in it, including data no property schema
anticipated. That makes it a privacy decision before it is a telemetry decision, and it is why the
spec extends privacy rather than forking an observability skill: traces are a nested run topology
that the flat Event Inventory cannot serve, so the Event Inventory is deliberately left untouched.

The subsection fixes six decisions that otherwise get deferred until after the data is already being
collected: what is captured, what redaction runs before storage and whether it runs before the trace
leaves the process, who can read a trace and whether that read is logged, retention and what deletes
it, the sampling fraction and how the sample is chosen, and whether users can decline. It also
records that a uniform sample is the wrong instrument for finding rare failures, so traces kept for
diagnosing bad output should oversample the cases a check already flagged.

**Why this is a MAJOR, and why it was first typed 2.3.0.** The content below shipped as a drafted
`2.3.0` minor on 2026-08-16, on the reasoning quoted in the struck sentence below: that a conditional
block is additive and therefore cannot break existing usage. The v2.33.0 G1 adversarial review
overturned that reasoning before the tag, and the ruling was to retype rather than defend it. `2.3.0`
never shipped.

Conditionality narrows *who* is affected; it does not change *what happens to them*. For an artifact
whose condition applies, the subsection is now required for completeness and a Quality Checklist item
must pass. That is the tie-breaker rule in [`skill-versioning.md`](../../docs/internal/skill-versioning.md)
verbatim: *"If a user must do something new to stay compliant with the skill's required contract,
classify as major"*, with the worked cases *"'You must now include section X' -> major"* and *"New
required checklist item added -> major"*.

A skill MAJOR does not imply a repo MAJOR; `skill-versioning.md` versions the repo independently, so
this ships inside the v2.33.0 minor.

~~Minor rather than patch: the subsection asks for decisions the skill previously did not request, and
adds an optional block to the artifact, which is additive behavior under the versioning tie-breaker.~~
**Corrected 2026-08-21 (G1 adversarial finding 1):** the block is conditional, not optional, and a
conditional requirement is still a requirement for the population it selects.

### Changes
- Added the conditional `Model Trace Capture` subsection under `PII & Privacy Considerations`.
- Instruction step 6 gained the conditional trace-capture guidance.
- Quality Checklist gained one conditional item.
- Event Inventory, User Properties, and Implementation Notes unchanged.
- Testing Checklist gains a conditional `Trace Capture Validation` block, present only when the spec
  captures model traces. It states **what must be proven and deliberately not how to prove it**:
  every row of the trace table needs a QA-owned test that could fail, covering the normal path and a
  failure or degraded path, recorded in a table naming where each test lives and who owns it, with
  untested rows listed as untested rather than omitted. Earlier drafts of this block authored the
  test choreography itself and were wrong ten times across eight adversarial rounds, passing
  vacuously in three distinct ways, which is why the choreography was removed at D22 rather than
  corrected again. Test design for a trace pipeline depends on collector topology and fault-injection
  mechanics that a PRD-time spec does not know.

## 2.2.0 (2026-07-04)

Released in [v2.30.0](../../site/src/content/docs/releases/Release_v2.30.0.md). Effort: M-35 (trust repair sweep).

The 2026-07-04 deep audit named the catalog's ~8 weakest early-cohort descriptions for rewrite (Batch 5). This skill and its companion `measure-dashboard-requirements` were picked as a pair: both original descriptions used the near-identical template with no cross-reference between them, despite each already disclaiming the other in its own "When NOT to Use" section and trigger fixtures.

### Changes
- Rewrote the frontmatter description (Batch 5, WS-T8e) to frame the spec as a product-engineering contract and surface the `measure-dashboard-requirements` deflection already present in the body.

No change to the Instructions, Output Format, or Quality Checklist.

## 2.1.0 (2026-06-10)

Quality-convergence minor (F-12 Batch 4): added a "When NOT to Use" section with boundary pointers to neighboring skills, and the Output Format now enumerates the template sections a complete artifact fills. No template or example changes.

## 2.0.0 (2026-01-26)

Baseline row for the prior published version; see git history for its changes.
