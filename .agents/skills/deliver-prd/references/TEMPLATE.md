| [Edge case 2] | [Behavior] |

## AI Behavior and Evaluation

<!-- CONDITIONAL, not optional. Include whenever the feature's output comes from a model and
     varies run to run, and skip it entirely for deterministic features. When the condition applies
     this section is REQUIRED for completeness: a PRD that meets the trigger and omits it does not
     satisfy the skill's contract.

     This section links behavior to evidence. It is not a full behavior specification: it names
     the behaviors that are requirements of THIS release and how each will be shown to hold. -->

### Behavior Requirements and Their Evidence

<!-- Refusal and abstention need their own rows. A model has no dependable default for either, so
     "what it does when it should not answer" is a requirement, not an implementation detail.
     Score each component of a multi-step feature separately: an end-to-end pass rate hides which
     step failed. -->

| ID | Behavior required | How it is evaluated | Passing threshold |
|----|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| AB-1 | [What the feature must do in the normal case] | [Cases, rubric, or check] | [Threshold, and how it was chosen] |
| AB-2 | [What it must refuse, and what it says instead] | [Cases, rubric, or check] | [Threshold, and how it was chosen] |
| AB-3 | [How it abstains when it cannot ground an answer] | [Cases, rubric, or check] | [Threshold, and how it was chosen] |

### Evaluation Set

<!-- Size this set by risk, not by saturation. "Keep adding cases until the verdict stops
     moving" is stopping on the outcome you are trying to measure: the answer depends on the
     order cases happen to arrive in, and the verdict usually stabilizes BEFORE the rare and
     harmful slices show up, because rare cases are rare. It reports a number with no coverage
     target behind it and then presents that number as release evidence.

     Name the slices first, set a floor per slice, then count. Do not state a fixed N here as
     a house default; N is derived per feature from the slices below.

     What a floor is, and what it is not. A floor is a COVERAGE commitment: it says every named
     failure mode was looked for deliberately, across a stated number of cases. It is not a
     measurement, and it is not a bound on how often the feature fails.

     This template deliberately does not tell you how to turn a case count into a failure-rate
     claim. Doing that honestly needs a sampling frame, a threshold fixed before the run, and
     independence assumptions that a hand-curated slice usually violates. A number that looks
     statistical but is not carries more authority than an obviously rough one, which makes it
     the more dangerous thing to put in a PRD. If the release genuinely turns on a rate, get a
     designed sample and someone who can defend it, and do not derive one here. -->

- **Where the cases live:** [Path or system]
- **Slices that must be covered:** [Derive them, do not guess. At minimum: every AB-n row above; every refusal and every abstention case; and the input classes where a failure costs the most - name the cost, not just the class]
- **Floor per slice, and what it commits you to:** [For each slice: the minimum cases you will not go below, and why that slice earns that floor. Say what the floor buys in coverage terms, which is that a named failure mode was searched for deliberately rather than incidentally. Do not state or imply a failure rate]
- **Held-out cases:** [The cases not used while tuning, kept back to check the thresholds still hold. If none are held out, say so and say why the thresholds are not overfit]
- **Slices scored separately:** [The segments reported on their own, never only in the aggregate. An aggregate that passes while one slice fails is a failing evaluation]
- **If someone asks for a rate:** [This set does not support one, and saying so is the correct answer. Report the raw counts per slice and the floor each was held to. A rate claim needs a designed sample, not a curated evaluation set, and inventing one here is how a PRD ends up carrying a number nobody can defend]

## Technical Considerations

<!-- Technical constraints, architectural notes, or integration requirements -->

### Constraints
- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]

### Integration Points
- [System/API 1]: [Integration notes]
- [System/API 2]: [Integration notes]

### Data Requirements
<!-- Any data migration, storage, or privacy considerations -->

[Data notes]

## Agent Execution Contract

<!-- CONDITIONAL, not optional. Include whenever a coding agent, an outside contractor, or any
     executor working without the authoring context will implement this PRD, and skip it entirely
     otherwise. When the condition applies this section is REQUIRED for completeness.

     Everything here is a declaration the author already knows and the executor cannot infer. -->

### Authoritative Sources

<!-- What the executor treats as ground truth, and which one wins when two disagree -->

| Source | Path or link | Definitive for |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| [Source 1] | [Path or link] | [Scope it settles] |
| [Source 2] | [Path or link] | [Scope it settles] |

### Do Not Touch

<!-- Files, systems, or configuration the executor must leave alone, and why. A path with no
     reason gets edited anyway the first time it looks convenient. -->

| Path or system | Reason it is off limits |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| [Path or system] | [Reason] |

### Requirement Verification Map

<!-- One row per FR-n above. A requirement with no verification is not ready to hand off, because
     nothing distinguishes "done" from "the executor believes it is done". -->

| Requirement | How it is verified | Who verifies |
|-------------|--------------------|--------------|
| FR-1 | [Test, check, or observation that proves it] | [Automated / QA / PM] |
| FR-2 | [Test, check, or observation that proves it] | [Automated / QA / PM] |

### Stop and Escalate

<!-- Conditions where the executor must stop and ask rather than decide. Name the owner: an
     escalation with no addressee becomes a guess. -->

| Condition | Escalate to |
|-----------|-------------|
| [Condition that must not be resolved unilaterally] | [Owner] |
| [Condition that must not be resolved unilaterally] | [Owner] |
